## Requesting an Absentee Ballot

You must request an absent voter ballot **in writing** by submitting the application, large print application, a letter, a postcard, or a pre-printed application form obtained from your local clerk's office. Requests may be returned by hand, via postal mail, fax, or email, as long as a signature is visible.

## Requesting an Emergency Absentee Ballot

You may make an "emergency" request for an absentee ballot if you cannot attend the polls because of:
* personal injury or illness
* a family death or illness that requires you to leave your community for the entire time the polls are open on election day

The emergency must have occurred after 5:00 pm on Friday prior to the election. If you are requesting an emergency absentee ballot, you may have someone deliver your written request for the ballot to your city or township clerk's office before 4 p.m. on election day.

Emergency ballots must be returned to the clerk's office by 8 p.m. on election day.
